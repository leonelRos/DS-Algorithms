/*
WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?
Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
 
Big O of Binary Heaps
Insertion -   O(log N)
Removal -   O(log N)
Search -   O(N)

Why do we need to know this?
Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures
They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

MAX BINARY HEAP
Each parent has at most two child nodes
The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

WHAT IS A
PRIORITY QUEUE?
A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

Write a Min Binary Heap - lower number means higher priority.
Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
Enqueue method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
Dequeue method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority.

Priority Queue is build from minBinaryHeap which menas lower number is the highest priority.
It is the same set up as the previous MaxBinary heap only changing acouple of things but adding the priority parameter

Insertion -   O(log N)
Removal -   O(log N)
Search -   O(N)
